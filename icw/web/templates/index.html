            <p><em>In Collision With</em> lets you browse national statistics about road traffic incidents that result
                in injury. It differentiates itself by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>linking to news articles about incidents, providing contextual information about what happened</li>
                <li>exposing all its data through an API</li>
                <li>being open-source â€” see our <a href="https://github.com/incollisionwith">repositories on GitHub</a>
                </li>
                <li>(soon) providing statistical views on the data</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It's still in its early stages, so please get in touch by <a
